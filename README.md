# Home Price Prediction Project
Welcome to the Home Price Prediction Project!

# Project Overview
In this project, I have developed a machine learning model to predict home prices based on various features such as location, number of bedrooms, square footage, and more. The goal is to provide accurate price predictions to help buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
